    Nurse: Good afternoon, Mr. Smith. I'm here to check on you before your surgery tomorrow.
    
    Patient: Hello. I'm quite nervous about tomorrow. My back pain has been really bad lately.
    
    Nurse: I understand your concerns. Let me check your vitals first. *takes measurements* Your blood pressure is 140/90, heart rate is 95, and temperature is 98.6¬∞F.
    
    Patient: Is my blood pressure too high? I've been taking my medication - metoprolol and amlodipine.
    
    Nurse: We'll monitor it closely. How would you rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10?
    
    Patient: Right now it's about a 7. It's been like this for 3 months since I injured my lower back at work.
    
    Nurse: Are you allergic to any medications?
    
    Patient: Yes, I'm allergic to codeine - it makes me very nauseous.
    
    Nurse: Thank you. I'll make sure that's documented for tomorrow's procedure.
